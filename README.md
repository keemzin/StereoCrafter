# Contributing to StereoCrafter WEBUI

## 🎯 About This Project

This is a **web-based UI fork** of the original [StereoCrafter](https://github.com/TencentARC/StereoCrafter) project by Tencent ARC Lab and by [Enoky](https://github.com/enoky/StereoCrafter) for the GUI implementation. This version is tested with a minimum RTX 6000 Ada ( Lovelace architecture ) and 48GB VRAM.

### Why a Web UI?

The original StereoCrafter uses CLI and Enoky tkinter-based desktop GUIs, which work great locally but have limitations:

- **Limited to local hardware** - You're stuck with the GPU you bought. You cannot increase the VRAM.
- **No remote access** - You can't process videos from anywhere.
- **Resource intensive** - High-end GPUs are expensive to own. Yet they output results faster.
- **OS, Batch and UI** - StereoCrafter is command-line usage only and can't do batch video file processing. Enoky is GUI-based and batch-processing enabled, but the python code is optimized for Windows 10/11 and might generate errors running on Linux/MacOS.

### Our Solution: Cloud-Ready Web Interface

By converting to a **Gradio-based web UI**, we enabled:

✅ **RunPod Integration** - Access high-end GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000) for pennies per hour  
✅ **Remote Processing** - Process videos from any device with a browser  
✅ **Cost Effective** - Pay only for GPU time you use, not ownership  
✅ **Scalability** - Spin up multiple instances for batch processing  
✅ **Accessibility** - Share processing power with team members  

**Example Cost Savings:**
- RTX 4090 ownership: ~$1,600 upfront
- RunPod RTX 4090: ~$0.50/hour (only when processing)
- Process 10 hours/month: $5 vs $1,600 investment

### Honorable Mention

All credit for the core StereoCrafter technology goes to the original authors at **Tencent ARC Lab**. This project simply wraps their excellent work in a web interface for cloud deployment.

## 🚀 Local Setup 

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended - Fastest & Easiest)

**Why Docker?**
- ✅ No dependency conflicts or DLL issues (especially on Windows)
- ✅ Simulates RunPod deployment environment exactly
- ✅ Pre-configured with all dependencies
- ✅ Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac
- ✅ One command to start everything

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- NVIDIA GPU with drivers installed
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) (for GPU support)

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keemzin/StereoCrafter.git
cd StereoCrafter

# Create .env file with your HuggingFace token
echo HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here > .env

# Start the container (downloads models on first run)
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Access the WebUI at http://localhost:7860
```

**With FileBrowser (optional):**

FileBrowser gives you a web-based file manager at port 8080 to browse/upload/download your input and output files.

Set credentials in `.env` before first run (minimum 12 characters for password):

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
FB_USERNAME=admin
FB_PASSWORD=adminadmin12
```

Then start with the FileBrowser compose file:

```bash
# Build the FileBrowser image (first time only)
docker build -f Dockerfile.filebrowser -t stereocrafter-filebrowser:local .

# Start with FileBrowser
docker-compose -f docker-compose.filebrowser.yml up -d

# Access:
#   StereoCrafter WebUI → http://localhost:7860
#   FileBrowser         → http://localhost:8080
```

To reset FileBrowser credentials:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.filebrowser.yml down
docker volume rm stereocrafter_filebrowser-data
docker-compose -f docker-compose.filebrowser.yml up -d
```

**Customizing Mounts:**

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to mount additional folders:

```yaml
volumes:
  # Your code (for live development)
  - ./webui.py:/workspace/StereoCrafter/webui.py
  - ./gui:/workspace/StereoCrafter/gui
  - ./stereocrafter_ui:/workspace/StereoCrafter/stereocrafter_ui
  
  # Model weights (persistent Docker volume - no Windows path issues)
  - stereocrafter-weights:/workspace/StereoCrafter/weights
  
  # Input/output folders (modify as needed)
  - ./source_video:/workspace/StereoCrafter/source_video
  - ./output_depthmaps:/workspace/StereoCrafter/output_depthmaps
  - ./output_splatted:/workspace/StereoCrafter/output_splatted
  - ./completed_output:/workspace/StereoCrafter/completed_output
  - ./final_videos:/workspace/StereoCrafter/final_videos
```

**Docker Commands:**

```bash
# Stop the container
docker compose down

# Restart after code changes
docker compose restart

# View container status
docker compose ps

# Access container shell
docker compose exec stereocrafter-webui bash

# Remove everything (including downloaded models)
docker compose down -v
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Python Virtual Environment)

**⚠️ Known Issues on Windows:**
- PyTorch DLL loading errors are common on Windows (`WinError 1114: DLL initialization failed`)
- Requires Visual C++ Redistributables and proper CUDA installation
- Can have conflicts with other Python installations or Anaconda
- **Docker is strongly recommended for Windows users**

**If you still want to try manual setup:**
### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Python 3.12**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- **CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive) (for GPU support)
- **FFmpeg**: [Installation guide](https://techtactician.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-and-add-it-to-path-on-windows/)
- **HuggingFace Account**: [Sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join) (HF_TOKEN needed for model downloads)

Verify installations:
```bash
git --version
python --version
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 1: Clone My StereoCrafter Fork

```bash
# Clone YOUR fork (keemzin/StereoCrafter)
git clone https://github.com/keemzin/StereoCrafter.git
cd StereoCrafter

# Add upstream remote for syncing with original enoky/StereoCrafter
git remote add upstream https://github.com/enoky/StereoCrafter.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

**Why clone from my fork?**

This WEBUI fork includes all the necessary code patches pre-applied. Cloning from `keemzin/StereoCrafter` gives you everything in one step.

**Can I update from the original enoky/StereoCrafter?**

Yes! Use the `upstream` remote to fetch updates from the original repository:

```bash
# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Check what's new
git log --oneline upstream/main -n 10

# Merge upstream changes (if compatible)
git merge upstream/main
```

### Step 2: Download Model Weights

Create a `weights` folder and download the required models:

```bash
# Create weights folder
mkdir weights
cd weights

# Download models using git
git clone https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/StereoCrafter
git clone https://huggingface.co/tencent/DepthCrafter
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1

cd ..
```

### Step 3: Set Up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run the WEBUI

```bash
# Start the web interface
python webui.py
```

The WEBUI will open in your browser at `http://localhost:7860`

**Troubleshooting Windows DLL Errors:**

If you get `OSError: [WinError 1114] A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed`:

1. **Install Visual C++ Redistributables:**
   - Download: [VC++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
   - Install and restart your computer

2. **Verify CUDA installation:**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   nvcc --version
   ```

3. **Reinstall PyTorch:**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
   ```

4. **If still failing, use Docker instead** (recommended solution)

**Why Docker is better for Windows:**
- No DLL conflicts
- Pre-configured environment
- Matches production RunPod environment exactly
- One command to start: `docker compose up -d`

### Common Issues

**PyTorch DLL errors on Windows (`WinError 1114`):**
```
OSError: [WinError 1114] A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.
Error loading "...\torch\lib\c10.dll"
```

**Solution:** Use Docker instead. This is a known Windows + PyTorch issue that's difficult to resolve. Docker works perfectly and matches the RunPod environment.

If you must use venv:
1. Install [VC++ Redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
2. Ensure CUDA 12.8 is properly installed
3. Reinstall PyTorch: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`

**Import errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**CUDA errors:**
- Verify CUDA 12.8 is installed
- Check GPU drivers are up to date
- Ensure PyTorch detects your GPU: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`

**Model download fails:**
- Check your HuggingFace token is valid
- Ensure you have accepted the model licenses on HuggingFace
- Try using Python download method instead of `uv`
